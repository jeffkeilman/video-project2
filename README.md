# video-front-end

A simple CRUD app that interacts with a Rails API. Videos favorites can be saved under user profiles. Video favorites can be updated and deleted. Specific information about a favorite can be pulled from the video API.

## technologies-used

- HTML/CSS/Sass
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- jQuery/AJAX

## future-iterations

I would like to add the ability to search for videos on YouTube itself and favorite them programmatically. I would like to add an embedded video player. A “music mode” would also be a nice addition, with a hidden video player and visible play settings.

## planning

I wrote user stories and a general plan. I drew up wireframes and an initial ERD.

## development-process

I did most of my development from front-end to back-end, testing along the way. I was able to write up AJAX requests to test my newly exposed API. This helped me diagnosis issues I ran into with my API and vice-versa.

User stories:
1. As a user, I want to be able to achieve basic user auth tasks.
2. As a user, I want to be able to add videos to my favorites list.
3. As a user, I want to be able to query my favorites by ID.
4. As a user, I want to be able to query my favorites by name.
5. As a user, I want to be able to view all of my favorites.
